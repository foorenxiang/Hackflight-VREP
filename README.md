# HackflightSim: A cross-platform flight simulator using the Hackflight firmware

<img src="hackflight.png">

Hackflight-Sim is a cross-platform flight simulator using the 
<a href="https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight">Hackflight</a> firmware.
Originally part of the Hackflight repository, Hackflight-Sim was broken off
into its own repository because of its much larger size.

Hackflight-Sim currently works with only the V-REP simulation tools, but
work is underway to get it working with the more realistic 
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim">Microsoft AirSim</a> as well.
